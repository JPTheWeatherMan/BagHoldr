Please work on seperate branches so that we don't step on each others toes. When you've made some progress you'd like to share with the group please open a pull request on github so that we may review it together to prevent breaking changes from making it into production.

If you're unfamiliar with branching and opening PRs please review the following blog post: https://ineza.codes/blog/intro-to-pull-requests-and-branches
